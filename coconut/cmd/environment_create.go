The operation may or may not be successful depending on available resources and configuration.

A valid workflow template (sometimes called simply "workflow" for brevity) must be passed to this command via the mandatory workflow-template flag.

Workflows and tasks are managed with a git based configuration system, so the workflow template may be provided simply by name or with repository and branch/tag/hash constraints.
Examples:
 * `+"`coconut env create -w myworkflow`"+` - loads workflow `+"`myworkflow`"+` from default configuration repository at HEAD of master branch
 * `+"`coconut env create -w github.com/AliceO2Group/MyConfRepo/myworkflow`"+` - loads a workflow from a specific git repository, HEAD of master branch
 * `+"`coconut env create -w myworkflow@rev`"+` - loads a workflow from default repository, on branch, tag or revision `+"`rev`"+`
 * `+"`coconut env create -w github.com/AliceO2Group/MyConfRepo/myworkflow@rev`"+` - loads a workflow from a specific git repository, on branch, tag or revision `+"`rev`"+`
