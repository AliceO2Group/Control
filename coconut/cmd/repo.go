// repoCmd represents the repository command
var repoCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "repository",
	Aliases: []string{"repo"},
	Short: "manage git repositories for task and workflow configuration",
	Long: `The repository command performs operations on the repositories used for task and workflow configuration.

A valid workflow configuration repository must contain the directories ` + "`tasks`" + ` and ` + "`workflows`" + ` in its ` + "`master`" + ` branch.

When referencing a repository, the clone method should never be prepended. Examples of valid repository identifiers:

` + "```" + `
github.com/AliceO2Group/ControlWorkflows
gitlab.cern.ch/tmrnjava/AliECS_conf/
` + "```" + `

By default, all short task and workflow names are assumed to be in the default repository (see ` + "`coconut repo list`" + ` command).

Any workflow from any repository can be loaded by providing a full and unique path, e.g. the following two are different workflows:
` + "```" + `
github.com/AliceO2Group/ControlWorkflows/workflows/readout-qc-1
gitlab.cern.ch/tmrnjava/AliECS_conf/workflows/readout-qc-1
` + "```" + `

By default a workflow is loaded from its state at HEAD in the master branch. A request to load a workflow can further be qualified with a branch, tag or commit hash:
` + "```" + `
readout-qc-1@readout-testing
gitlab.cern.ch/tmrnjava/AliECS_conf/workflows/readout-qc-1@5c7f1c1f
` + "```" + `

Make sure to run ` + "`coconut repo refresh`" + ` if you make changes to a configuration repository.`,
