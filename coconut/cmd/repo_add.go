// repoAddCmd represents the repo add command
var repoAddCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "add <repo url>",
	Aliases: []string{"new", "a"},
	Short: "add a new git repository",
	Long: `The repository add command adds a git repository to the catalogue of repositories used for task and workflow configuration.
The default revision of the repository may be explicitly specified by passing the flag ` + "`--default-revision`" + ` . In any case,
the ensuing list is followed until a valid revision has been identified:

- explicitly set default revision (optional)
- global default revision
- ` + "`master`" + `
- ` + "`main`" + `

Exhaustion of the aforementioned list results in a repo add failure.

` + "`coconut repo add`" +  ` can be called with
1) a repository identifier
2) a repository identifier coupled with the ` + "`--default-revision`" + ` flag (see examples below)

The ` + "`https://`" + ` prefix and ` + "`.git`" + ` suffix should always be omitted.`,
	Example:
	` * ` + "`coconut repo add github.com/AliceO2Group/ControlWorkflows`" + `
 * ` + "`coconut repo add github.com/AliceO2Group/ControlWorkflows --default-revision custom-rev`" + `
 * ` + "`coconut repo add alio2-cr1-hv-web.cern.ch:/opt/git/ControlWorkflows --default-revision custom-rev`" + `
 * ` + "`coconut repo add /home/flp/git/ControlWorkflows`",
	Run:  control.WrapCall(control.AddRepo),
	Args: cobra.ExactArgs(1),
