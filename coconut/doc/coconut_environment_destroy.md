## coconut environment destroy

destroy an environment

### Synopsis

The environment destroy command instructs AliECS to
teardown an existing O² environment. The environment must be in the 
CONFIGURED or STANDBY state.

By default, all active tasks are killed unless the keep-tasks flag is passed, in which case all tasks are left idle.

```
coconut environment destroy [environment id] [flags]
```

  -a, --allow-in-running-state   allows destroying an environment while in Running state
