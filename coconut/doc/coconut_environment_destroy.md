## coconut environment destroy

destroy an environment

### Synopsis

The environment destroy command instructs AliECS to
teardown an existing OÂ² environment. The environment must be in the 
CONFIGURED or STANDBY state.

By default, all active tasks are killed unless the keep-tasks flag is passed, in which case all tasks are left idle.

```
