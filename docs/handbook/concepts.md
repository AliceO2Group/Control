# Basic Concepts

From a logical point of view of data processing deployment and control, AliECS deals with concepts such as **environments**, **roles** and **tasks**, the understanding of which is paramount for using AliECS effectively.

The basic unit of scheduling in AliECS is a **task**. A task generally corresponds to a process. Sometimes this is a process that can receive and respond to OCC-compatible control messages (also called a **stateful task**), and other times this is simply a shell script or command line tool invocation (also called a **stateless task** or **basic task**).

All AliECS **workflows** are collections of tasks, which together form a coherent data processing chain.

Tasks are the leaves in a tree of roles. A **role** is a runtime subdivision of the complete system, it represents a kind of operation along with its resources (but less than a complete data processing chain). Each task implements one or more roles. Roles allow binding tasks or groups of tasks to specific host attributes, detectors and configuration values. Each role represents either a single task, or a group of child roles. If tasks are leaves, roles are all the other nodes in the control tree of an environment.

These novel, more flexible and more easily deployable abstractions represent the evolution of Run 2 abstractions such as ECS partitions. In memory, a tree of OÂ² roles, along with their tasks and their configuration is a **workflow**. A workflow aggregates the collective state of its constituent O2 roles. A running workflow, along with associated detectors and other hardware and software resources required for experiment operation constitutes an **environment**.
